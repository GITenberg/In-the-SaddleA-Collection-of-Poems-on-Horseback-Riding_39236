<h2>A DAY'S RIDE: A LIFE'S ANALOGY.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Mid tangled forest and o'er grass plains wide,</span>
<span class="i2">By many a devious path and bridle-way,</span>
<span class="i2">Through the short brightness of an Indian day,</span>
<span class="i0">In middle winter 'twas my lot to ride,</span>
<span class="i0">Skirting the round-topped, pine-clad mountain side,</span>
<span class="i2">While far away upon the steely blue</span>
<span class="i2">Horizon, half concealèd, half in view,</span>
<span class="i0">Himalay's peaks upreared their snow-crowned pride,</span>
<span class="i0">In utter purity and vast repose.</span>
<span class="i2">I, ere the first faint flush of morning glowed</span>
<span class="i2">Within her eastern chamber, took the road,</span>
<span class="i2">And, slowly riding between day and night,</span>
<span class="i2">I marked how, through the wan, imperfect light,</span>
<span class="i0">Ghost-like and gray loomed the eternal snows.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So near they seemed, each crack and crevice small</span>
<span class="i2">Like bas-relief work showed, while in the light</span>
<span class="i2">Of ruddy morn, gray changed through pink to white.</span>
<span class="i0">But soon the sun, up-climbing, flooded all</span>
<span class="i0">The heavens, and then a thin and misty pall</span>
<span class="i2">Of exhalations rose, and pale of hue</span>
<span class="i2">And fainter ever those far summits grew,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Until the day waned low, and shadows tall</span>
<span class="i0">Sloped eastward. Then once more, in radiance clear,</span>
<span class="i2">Of setting sunlight, beautiful as brief,</span>
<span class="i2">Each peak and crag stood out in bold relief,</span>
<span class="i2">Till, slowly, pink faded to ghostly gray.</span>
<span class="i2">So through life's morning, noontide, evening, may</span>
<span class="i0">Ideal hopes dawn, fade, and reappear.</span>

<span class="i0">Hurrah! for a ride in the morning gray,</span>
<span class="i4">On the back of a bounding steed.</span>
<span class="i0">What pleasure to list how the wild winds play;</span>
<span class="i0">Hark! Hark! to their music,&mdash;away! away!</span>
<span class="i4">Gallop away with speed.</span>

<h2>THE HORSEBACK RIDE.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When troubled in spirit, when weary of life,</span>
<span class="i0">When I faint 'neath its burdens, and shrink from its strife,</span>
<span class="i0">When its fruits, turned to ashes, are mocking my taste,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And its fairest scene seems but a desolate waste,</span>
<span class="i0">Then come ye not near me, my sad heart to cheer</span>
<span class="i0">With friendship's soft accents or sympathy's tear.</span>
<span class="i0">No pity I ask, and no counsel I need,</span>
<span class="i0">But bring me, oh, bring me my gallant young steed,</span>
<span class="i0">With his high archèd neck, and his nostril spread wide,</span>
<span class="i0">His eye full of fire, and his step full of pride!</span>
<span class="i0">As I spring to his back, as I seize the strong rein,</span>
<span class="i0">The strength to my spirit returneth again!</span>
<span class="i0">The bonds are all broken that fettered my mind,</span>
<span class="i0">And my cares borne away on the wings of the wind;</span>
<span class="i0">My pride lifts its head, for a season bowed down,</span>
<span class="i0">And the queen in my nature now puts on her crown!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now we're off&mdash;like the winds to the plains whence they came;</span>
<span class="i0">And the rapture of motion is thrilling my frame!</span>
<span class="i0">On, on speeds my courser, scarce printing the sod,</span>
<span class="i0">Scarce crushing a daisy to mark where he trod!</span>
<span class="i0">On, on like a deer, when the hound's early bay</span>
<span class="i0">Awakes the wild echoes, away, and away!</span>
<span class="i0">Still faster, still farther, he leaps at my cheer,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the rush of the startled air whirs in my ear!</span>
<span class="i0">Now 'long a clear rivulet lieth his track,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">See his glancing hoofs tossing the white pebbles back!</span>
<span class="i0">Now a glen dark as midnight&mdash;what matter?&mdash;we'll down</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Though shadows are round us, and rocks o'er us frown;</span>
<span class="i0">The thick branches shake as we're hurrying through,</span>
<span class="i0">And deck us with spangles of silvery dew!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What a wild thought of triumph, that this girlish hand</span>
<span class="i0">Such a steed in the might of his strength may command!</span>
<span class="i0">What a glorious creature! Ah! glance at him now,</span>
<span class="i0">As I check him a while on this green hillock's brow;</span>
<span class="i0">How he tosses his mane, with a shrill joyous neigh,</span>
<span class="i0">And paws the firm earth in his proud, stately play!</span>
<span class="i0">Hurrah! off again, dashing on as in ire,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the long, flinty pathway is flashing with fire!</span>
<span class="i0">Ho! a ditch!&mdash;Shall we pause? No; the bold leap we dare,</span>
<span class="i0">Like a swift-wingèd arrow we rush through the air!</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, not all the pleasures that poets may praise,</span>
<span class="i0">Not the 'wildering waltz in the ball-room's blaze,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor the chivalrous joust, nor the daring race,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor the swift regatta, nor merry chase,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor the sail, high heaving waters o'er,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor the rural dance on the moonlight shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Can the wild and thrilling joy exceed</span>
<span class="i0">Of a fearless leap on a fiery steed!</span>

<h2>IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am the Lady Irmingard,</span>
<span class="i0">Born of a noble race and name!</span>
<span class="i0">Many a wandering Suabian bard,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose life was dreary and bleak and hard,</span>
<span class="i0">Has found through me the way to fame.</span>
<span class="i0">Brief and bright were those days, and the night</span>
<span class="i0">Which followed was full of a lurid light.</span>
<span class="i0">Love, that of every woman's heart</span>
<span class="i0">Will have the whole, and not a part,</span>
<span class="i0">That is to her, in Nature's plan,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">More than ambition is to man,</span>
<span class="i0">Her light, her life, her very breath,</span>
<span class="i0">With no alternative but death,</span>
<span class="i0">Found me a maiden soft and young,</span>
<span class="i0">Just from the convent's cloistered school,</span>
<span class="i0">And seated on my lowly stool,</span>
<span class="i0">Attentive while the minstrels sung.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gallant, graceful, gentle, tall,</span>
<span class="i0">Fairest, noblest, best of all,</span>
<span class="i0">Was Walter of the Vogelweid;</span>
<span class="i0">And, whatsoever may betide,</span>
<span class="i0">Still I think of him with pride!</span>
<span class="i0">His song was of the summer-time,</span>
<span class="i0">The very birds sang in his rhyme;</span>
<span class="i0">The sunshine, the delicious air,</span>
<span class="i0">The fragrance of the flowers, were there;</span>
<span class="i0">And I grew restless as I heard,</span>
<span class="i0">Restless and buoyant as a bird,</span>
<span class="i0">Down soft, aerial currents sailing,</span>
<span class="i0">O'er blossomed orchards, and fields in bloom,</span>
<span class="i0">And through the momentary gloom</span>
<span class="i0">Of shadows o'er the landscape trailing,</span>
<span class="i0">Yielding and borne I knew not where,</span>
<span class="i0">But feeling resistance unavailing.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus, unnoticed and apart,</span>
<span class="i0">And more by accident than choice,</span>
<span class="i0">I listened to that single voice</span>
<span class="i0">Until the chambers of my heart</span>
<span class="i0">Were filled with it by night and day.</span>
<span class="i0">One night&mdash;it was a night in May,&mdash;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Within the garden, unawares,</span>
<span class="i0">Under the blossoms in the gloom,</span>
<span class="i0">I heard it utter my own name</span>
<span class="i0">With protestations and wild prayers;</span>
<span class="i0">And it rang through me, and became</span>
<span class="i0">Like the archangel's trump of doom,</span>
<span class="i0">Which the soul hears, and must obey;</span>
<span class="i0">And mine arose as from a tomb.</span>
<span class="i0">My former life now seemed to me</span>
<span class="i0">Such as hereafter death may be,</span>
<span class="i0">When in the great Eternity</span>
<span class="i0">We shall awake and find it day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was a dream, and would not stay;</span>
<span class="i0">A dream, that in a single night</span>
<span class="i0">Faded and vanished out of sight.</span>
<span class="i0">My father's anger followed fast</span>
<span class="i0">This passion, as a freshening blast</span>
<span class="i0">Seeks out and fans the fire, whose rage</span>
<span class="i0">It may increase, but not assuage.</span>
<span class="i0">And he exclaimed: "No wandering bard</span>
<span class="i0">Shall win thy hand, O Irmingard!</span>
<span class="i0">For which Prince Henry of Hoheneck</span>
<span class="i0">By messenger and letter sues."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gently, but firmly, I replied:</span>
<span class="i0">"Henry of Hoheneck I discard!</span>
<span class="i0">Never the hand of Irmingard</span>
<span class="i0">Shall lie in his as the hand of a bride!"</span>
<span class="i0">This said I, Walter, for thy sake;</span>
<span class="i0">This said I, for I could not choose.</span>
<span class="i0">After a pause, my father spake</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In that cold and deliberate tone</span>
<span class="i0">Which turns the hearer into stone,</span>
<span class="i0">And seems itself the act to be</span>
<span class="i0">That follows with such dread certainty;</span>
<span class="i0">"This, or the cloister and the veil!"</span>
<span class="i0">No other words than these he said,</span>
<span class="i0">But they were like a funeral wail;</span>
<span class="i0">My life was ended, my heart was dead.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That night from the castle-gate went down,</span>
<span class="i0">With silent, slow, and stealthy pace,</span>
<span class="i0">Two shadows, mounted on shadowy steeds,</span>
<span class="i0">Taking the narrow path that leads</span>
<span class="i0">Into the forest dense and brown.</span>
<span class="i0">In the leafy darkness of the place,</span>
<span class="i0">One could not distinguish form nor face,</span>
<span class="i0">Only a bulk without a shape,</span>
<span class="i0">A darker shadow in the shade;</span>
<span class="i0">One scarce could say it moved or stayed.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus it was we made our escape!</span>
<span class="i0">A foaming brook, with many a bound,</span>
<span class="i0">Followed us like a playful hound;</span>
<span class="i0">Then leaped before us, and in the hollow</span>
<span class="i0">Paused, and waited for us to follow,</span>
<span class="i0">And seemed impatient, and afraid</span>
<span class="i0">That our tardy flight should be betrayed</span>
<span class="i0">By the sound our horses' hoof-beats made.</span>
<span class="i0">And when we reached the plain below,</span>
<span class="i0">We paused a moment and drew rein</span>
<span class="i0">To look back at the castle again;</span>
<span class="i0">And we saw the windows all aglow</span>
<span class="i0">With lights, that were passing to and fro;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts with terror ceased to beat;</span>
<span class="i0">The brook crept silent to our feet;</span>
<span class="i0">We knew what most we feared to know.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then suddenly horns began to blow;</span>
<span class="i0">And we heard a shout, and a heavy tramp,</span>
<span class="i0">And our horses snorted in the damp</span>
<span class="i0">Night-air of the meadows green and wide,</span>
<span class="i0">And in a moment, side by side,</span>
<span class="i0">So close, they must have seemed but one,</span>
<span class="i0">The shadows across the moonlight run,</span>
<span class="i0">And another came, and swept behind,</span>
<span class="i0">Like the shadow of clouds before the wind!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How I remember that breathless flight</span>
<span class="i0">Across the moors, in the summer night!</span>
<span class="i0">How under our feet the long, white road</span>
<span class="i0">Backward like a river flowed,</span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping with it fences and hedges,</span>
<span class="i0">Whilst farther away, and overhead,</span>
<span class="i0">Paler than I, with fear and dread,</span>
<span class="i0">The moon fled with us, as we fled</span>
<span class="i0">Along the forest's jagged edges!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All this I can remember well;</span>
<span class="i0">But of what afterwards befell</span>
<span class="i0">I nothing further can recall</span>
<span class="i0">Than a blind, desperate, headlong fall;</span>
<span class="i0">The rest is a blank and darkness all.</span>
<span class="i0">When I awoke out of this swoon,</span>
<span class="i0">The sun was shining, not the moon,</span>
<span class="i0">Making a cross upon the wall</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With the bars of my windows narrow and tall;</span>
<span class="i0">And I prayed to it, as I had been wont to pray,</span>
<span class="i0">From early childhood, day by day,</span>
<span class="i0">Each morning, as in bed I lay!</span>
<span class="i0">I was lying again in my own room!</span>
<span class="i0">And I thanked God, in my fever and pain,</span>
<span class="i0">That those shadows on the midnight plain</span>
<span class="i0">Were gone, and could not come again!</span>
<span class="i0">I struggled no longer with my doom!</span>

<h2>HARRAS, THE BOLD LEAPER.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world yet waited in shadowy light</span>
<span class="i2">The dawn of the rising day;</span>
<span class="i0">And scarcely yet had waked the night</span>
<span class="i2">From the slumber in which it lay.</span>
<span class="i0">But, hark! along the forest way</span>

<span class="i2">But as they leave its shade</span>
<span class="i0">They rush, alas! to meet their doom,</span>
<span class="i2">And their progress is betrayed:</span>
<span class="i0">For suddenly bursts upon their rear</span>
<span class="i2">The foe, with twice their force;</span>
<span class="i0">Then out at once rush shield and spear,</span>
<span class="i2">And the charger flies on his course.</span>

<span class="i0">A thousand wounds have dyed the field</span>

<span class="i0">And his brave steed carried him through the fight,</span>

<span class="i2">The remnant of his band;</span>
<span class="i0">And his heart impatient panted high,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<span class="i2">As they waved the friendly hand.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he longed, as he looked o'er that dreadful steep,</span>

<span class="i0">For that cliff is full fifty fathoms deep,</span>
<span class="i2">And his horse drew back with fright.</span>
<span class="i0">And he saw, as he looked behind and below,</span>
<span class="i2">On either side his grave:</span>
<span class="i0">Behind him, from the coming foe;</span>
<span class="i2">Before him, in the wave!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he chooses 'twixt death from the foemen's hand,</span>
<span class="i2">Or death where the deep waves roll;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he boldly rides up to that rocky strand,</span>
<span class="i2">And commends to the Lord his soul!</span>
<span class="i0">And as nearer he hears the foemen ride,</span>
<span class="i2">He seeks the utmost steep;</span>
<span class="i0">And he plunges his spurs in his courser's side,</span>
<span class="i2">And dares the dreadful leap!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And swiftly he sank through the yielding air,</span>
<span class="i2">And into the flood he fell;</span>
<span class="i0">His steed is dashed to atoms there,</span>
<span class="i2">But the knight lives safe and well!</span>
<span class="i0">And mid the plaudits of his band,</span>
<span class="i2">He stemmed the parting wave,</span>
<span class="i0">And soon in safety reached the land,</span>

<span class="i0">The fatal byword of all years to come,</span>
<span class="i0">Boring a little auger-hole in fear,</span>
<span class="i0">Peeped&mdash;but his eyes, before they had their will,</span>
<span class="i0">Were shrivelled into darkness in his head,</span>
<span class="i0">And dropt before him. So the Powers, who wait</span>
<span class="i0">On noble deeds, cancelled a sense misused;</span>
<span class="i0">And she, that knew not, passed: and all at once,</span>
<span class="i0">With twelve great shocks of sound, the shameless noon</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Was clashed and hammered from a hundred towers,</span>
<span class="i0">One after one: but even then she gained</span>
<span class="i0">Her bower; whence reissuing, robed and crowned,</span>
<span class="i0">To meet her lord, she took the tax away,</span>
<span class="i0">And built herself an everlasting name.</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace</span>

<span class="i2">Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit,</span>
<span class="i0">Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;</span>
<span class="i0">At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;</span>
<span class="i0">At Düffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And against him the cattle stood black every one,</span>
<span class="i0">To stare through the mist at us galloping past,</span>
<span class="i0">And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,</span>
<span class="i0">With resolute shoulders, each butting away</span>
<span class="i0">The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back</span>
<span class="i0">For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;</span>
<span class="i0">And one eye's black intelligence,&mdash;ever that glance</span>
<span class="i0">O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!</span>
<span class="i0">And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon</span>
<span class="i0">His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!</span>

<span class="i0">Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,</span>

<span class="i0">So we were left galloping, Joris and I,</span>
<span class="i0">Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;</span>
<span class="i0">The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,</span>
<span class="i0">'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Listen, my children, and you shall hear</span>
<span class="i0">Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,</span>
<span class="i0">On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;</span>
<span class="i0">Hardly a man is now alive</span>
<span class="i0">Who remembers that famous day and year.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said to his friend, "If the British march</span>
<span class="i0">By land or sea from the town to-night,</span>
<span class="i0">Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</span>
<span class="i0">Of the North Church tower as a signal light,&mdash;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="i0">One, if by land, and two, if by sea;</span>

<span class="i0">Ready to ride and spread the alarm</span>
<span class="i0">Through every Middlesex village and farm,</span>
<span class="i0">For the country folk to be up and to arm."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he said, "Good night!" and with muffled oar</span>
<span class="i0">Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Just as the moon rose over the bay,</span>
<span class="i0">Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</span>
<span class="i0">The Somerset, British man-of-war;</span>
<span class="i0">A phantom ship, with each mast and spar</span>
<span class="i0">Across the moon like a prison bar,</span>
<span class="i0">And a huge black hulk, that was magnified</span>
<span class="i0">By its own reflection in the tide.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,</span>
<span class="i0">Wanders and watches with eager ears,</span>
<span class="i0">Till in the silence around him he hears</span>
<span class="i0">The muster of men at the barrack door,</span>
<span class="i0">The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And the measured tread of the grenadiers,</span>
<span class="i0">Marching down to their boats on the shore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,</span>
<span class="i0">By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,</span>
<span class="i0">To the belfry-chamber overhead,</span>
<span class="i0">And startled the pigeons from their perch</span>
<span class="i0">On the sombre rafters, that round him made</span>
<span class="i0">Masses and moving shapes of shade,&mdash;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,</span>
<span class="i0">To the highest window in the wall,</span>
<span class="i0">Where he paused to listen and look down</span>
<span class="i0">A moment on the roofs of the town,</span>
<span class="i0">And the moonlight flowing over all.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,</span>
<span class="i0">In their night-encampment on the hill,</span>
<span class="i0">Wrapped in silence so deep and still</span>
<span class="i0">That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,</span>
<span class="i0">The watchful night-wind, as it went</span>
<span class="i0">Creeping along from tent to tent,</span>
<span class="i0">And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"</span>
<span class="i0">A moment only he feels the spell</span>
<span class="i0">Of the place and hour, and the secret dread</span>
<span class="i0">Of the lonely belfry and the dead;</span>
<span class="i0">For suddenly all his thoughts are bent</span>
<span class="i0">On a shadowy something far away,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the river widens to meet the bay,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A line of black that bends and floats</span>
<span class="i0">On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,</span>
<span class="i0">Booted and spurred with a heavy stride</span>
<span class="i0">On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.</span>
<span class="i0">Now he patted his horse's side,</span>
<span class="i0">Now gazed at the landscape far and near,</span>
<span class="i0">Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;</span>
<span class="i0">But mostly he watched with eager search</span>
<span class="i0">The belfry-tower of the Old North Church,</span>
<span class="i0">As it rose above the graves on the hill,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.</span>
<span class="i0">And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height</span>
<span class="i0">A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!</span>
<span class="i0">He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,</span>
<span class="i0">But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight</span>
<span class="i0">A second lamp in the belfry burns!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A hurry of hoofs in a village street,</span>
<span class="i0">A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,</span>

<span class="i0">Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:</span>
<span class="i0">That was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light,</span>
<span class="i0">The fate of a nation was riding that night;</span>
<span class="i0">And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,</span>
<span class="i0">Kindled the land into flame with its heat.</span>
<span class="i0">He has left the village and mounted the steep,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was twelve by the village clock</span>
<span class="i0">When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.</span>

<span class="i0">That rises after the sun goes down.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was one by the village clock,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When he galloped into Lexington.</span>
<span class="i0">He saw the gilded weathercock</span>
<span class="i0">Swim in the moonlight as he passed,</span>
<span class="i0">And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,</span>
<span class="i0">Gaze at him with a spectral glare,</span>
<span class="i0">As if they already stood aghast</span>
<span class="i0">At the bloody work they would look upon.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was two by the village clock,</span>
<span class="i0">When he came to the bridge in Concord town.</span>
<span class="i0">He heard the bleating of the flock,</span>

<span class="i0">And felt the breath of the morning breeze</span>
<span class="i0">Blowing over the meadows brown.</span>
<span class="i0">And one was safe and asleep in his bed</span>
<span class="i0">Who at the bridge would be first to fall,</span>

<span class="i0">Of battle, with rage and with bellowings loud</span>
<span class="i0">And unearthly, and up through its lowering cloud</span>
<span class="i0">Came the flash of his eyes like a half-hidden fire,</span>
<span class="i0">While his keen crooked horns, through the storm of his mane,</span>
<span class="i0">Like black lances lifted and lifted again;</span>
<span class="i0">And I looked but this once, for the fire licked through,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>

<span class="i0">She met Revels and me in her perilous flight</span>
<span class="i0">From the lodge of the chief to the North Brazos side;</span>

<h2>TAMING THE WILD HORSE.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Last night he trampled with a thousand steeds</span>
<span class="i0">The trembling desert. Now, he stands alone&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">His speed hath baffled theirs. His fellows lurk,</span>
<span class="i0">Behind, on heavy sands, with weary limbs</span>
<span class="i0">That cannot reach him. From the highest hill,</span>
<span class="i0">He gazes o'er the wild whose plains he spurned,</span>
<span class="i0">And his eye kindles, and his breast expands,</span>
<span class="i0">With an upheaving consciousness of might.</span>
<span class="i0">He stands an instant, then he breaks away,</span>
<span class="i0">As revelling in his freedom. What if art,</span>
<span class="i0">That strikes soul into marble, could but seize</span>
<span class="i0">That agony of action,&mdash;could impress</span>
<span class="i0">Its muscular fulness, with its winged haste,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the resisting rock, while wonder stares,</span>
<span class="i0">And admiration worships? There,&mdash;away&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">As glorying in that mighty wilderness,</span>
<span class="i0">And conscious of the gazing skies o'erhead,</span>
<span class="i0">Quiver for flight, his sleek and slender limbs,</span>
<span class="i0">Elastic, springing into headlong force&mdash;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While his smooth neck, curved loftily to arch,</span>
<span class="i0">Dignifies flight, and to his speed imparts</span>
<span class="i0">The majesty, not else its attribute.</span>
<span class="i0">And, circling, now he sweeps, the flowery plain,</span>
<span class="i0">As if 'twere his&mdash;imperious, gathering up</span>
<span class="i0">His limbs, unwearied by their sportive play,</span>
<span class="i0">Until he stands, an idol of the sight.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He stands and trembles! The warm life is gone</span>
<span class="i0">That gave him action. Wherefore is it thus?</span>
<span class="i0">His eye hath lost its lustre, though it still</span>
<span class="i0">Sends forth a glance of consciousness and care,</span>
<span class="i0">To a deep agony of acuteness wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">And straining at a point&mdash;a narrow point&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">That rises, but a speck upon the verge</span>
<span class="i0">Of the horizon. Sure, the humblest life,</span>
<span class="i0">Hath, in God's providence, some gracious guides,</span>
<span class="i0">That warn it of its foe. The danger there,</span>
<span class="i0">His instinct teaches, and with growing dread,</span>
<span class="i0">No more solicitous of graceful flight,</span>
<span class="i0">He bounds across the plain&mdash;he speeds away,</span>
<span class="i0">Into the tameless wilderness afar,</span>
<span class="i0">To 'scape his bondage. Yet, in vain his flight&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Vain his fleet limbs, his desperate aim, his leap</span>
<span class="i0">Through the close thicket, through the festering swamp,</span>
<span class="i0">And rushing waters. His proud neck must bend</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a halter, and the iron parts</span>
<span class="i0">And tears his delicate mouth. The brave steed,</span>
<span class="i0">Late bounding in his freedom's consciousness,</span>
<span class="i0">The leader of the wild, unreached of all,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Wears gaudy trappings, and becomes a slave.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He bears a master on his shrinking back,</span>
<span class="i0">He feels a rowel in his bleeding flanks,</span>
<span class="i0">And his arched neck, beneath the biting thong,</span>
<span class="i0">Burns, while he bounds away&mdash;all desperate&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Across the desert, mad with the vain hope</span>
<span class="i0">To shake his burden off. He writhes, he turns</span>
<span class="i0">On his oppressor. He would rend the foe,</span>
<span class="i0">Who subtle, with less strength, had taken him thus,</span>
<span class="i0">At foul advantage&mdash;but he strives in vain.</span>
<span class="i0">A sudden pang&mdash;a newer form of pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Baffles, and bears him on&mdash;he feels his fate,</span>
<span class="i0">And with a shriek of agony, which tells,</span>
<span class="i0">Loudly, the terrors of his new estate,</span>
<span class="i0">He makes the desert&mdash;his own desert&mdash;ring</span>
<span class="i0">With the wild clamors of his new born grief.</span>
<span class="i0">One fruitless effort more&mdash;one desperate bound,</span>
<span class="i0">For the old freedom of his natural life,</span>
<span class="i0">And then he humbles to his cruel lot,</span>
<span class="i0">Submits, and finds his conqueror in man!</span>

<h2>THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN.</h2>

<h3>SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED, AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John Gilpin was a citizen</span>
<span class="i2">Of credit and renown,</span>
<span class="i0">A trainband captain eke was he</span>
<span class="i2">Of famous London town.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,</span>
<span class="i2">"Though wedded we have been</span>
<span class="i0">These twice ten tedious years, yet we</span>
<span class="i1">No holiday have seen.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To morrow is our wedding-day,</span>
<span class="i2">And we will then repair</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the Bell at Edmonton</span>
<span class="i2">All in a chaise and pair.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My sister, and my sister's child,</span>
<span class="i2">Myself, and children three,</span>
<span class="i0">Will fill the chaise; so you must ride</span>
<span class="i2">On horseback after we."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He soon replied, "I do admire</span>
<span class="i2">Of womankind but one,</span>
<span class="i0">And you are she, my dearest dear,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore it shall be done.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am a linendraper bold,</span>
<span class="i2">As all the world doth know,</span>
<span class="i0">And my good friend the calender</span>
<span class="i2">Will lend his horse to go."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said;</span>
<span class="i2">And for that wine is dear,</span>
<span class="i0">We will be furnished with our own,</span>
<span class="i2">Which is both bright and clear."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;</span>
<span class="i2">O'erjoyed was he to find,</span>
<span class="i0">That, though on pleasure she was bent,</span>
<span class="i2">She had a frugal mind.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The morning came, the chaise was brought,</span>
<span class="i2">But yet was not allowed</span>
<span class="i0">To drive up to the door, lest all</span>
<span class="i2">Should say that she was proud.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So three doors off the chaise was stayed,</span>
<span class="i2">Where they did all get in;</span>
<span class="i0">Six precious souls, and all agog</span>
<span class="i2">To dash through thick and thin.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,</span>
<span class="i2">Were never folks so glad;</span>
<span class="i0">The stones did rattle underneath,</span>
<span class="i2">As if Cheapside were mad.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John Gilpin at his horse's side</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Seized fast the flowing mane,</span>
<span class="i0">And up he got, in haste to ride,</span>
<span class="i2">But soon came down again;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,</span>
<span class="i2">His journey to begin,</span>
<span class="i0">When, turning round his head, he saw</span>
<span class="i2">Three customers come in.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So down he came; for loss of time,</span>
<span class="i2">Although it grieved him sore,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,</span>
<span class="i2">Would trouble him much more.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas long before the customers</span>
<span class="i2">Were suited to their mind,</span>
<span class="i0">When Betty screaming came down stairs,</span>
<span class="i2">"The wine is left behind!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,</span>
<span class="i2">My leathern belt likewise,</span>
<span class="i0">In which I bear my trusty sword</span>
<span class="i2">When I do exercise."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)</span>
<span class="i2">Had two stone bottles found,</span>
<span class="i0">To hold the liquor that she loved,</span>
<span class="i2">And keep it safe and sound.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each bottle had a curling ear,</span>
<span class="i2">Through which the belt he drew,</span>
<span class="i0">And hung a bottle on each side,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
<span class="i2">To make his balance true.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then over all, that he might be</span>
<span class="i2">Equipped from top to toe,</span>
<span class="i0">His long-red cloak, well brushed and neat,</span>
<span class="i1">He manfully did throw.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now see him mounted once again</span>
<span class="i2">Upon his nimble steed,</span>
<span class="i0">Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,</span>
<span class="i2">With caution and good heed.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But finding soon a smoother road</span>
<span class="i2">Beneath his well-shod feet,</span>
<span class="i0">The snorting beast began to trot,</span>
<span class="i2">Which galled him in his seat.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So, fair and softly," John he cried,</span>
<span class="i2">But John he cried in vain;</span>
<span class="i0">That trot became a gallop soon,</span>
<span class="i2">In spite of curb and rein.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So stooping down, as needs he must</span>
<span class="i2">Who cannot sit upright,</span>
<span class="i0">He grasped the mane with both his hands,</span>
<span class="i2">And eke with all his might.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His horse, who never in that sort</span>
<span class="i2">Had handled been before,</span>
<span class="i0">What thing upon his back had got</span>
<span class="i2">Did wonder more and more.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away went Gilpin, neck or naught;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Away went hat and wig;</span>
<span class="i0">He little dreamt, when he set out,</span>
<span class="i2">Of running such a rig.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,</span>
<span class="i2">Like streamer long and gay,</span>
<span class="i0">Till, loop and button failing both,</span>
<span class="i2">At last it flew away.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then might all people well discern</span>
<span class="i2">The bottles he had slung;</span>
<span class="i0">A bottle swinging at each side,</span>
<span class="i2">As hath been said or sung.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dogs did bark, the children screamed,</span>
<span class="i2">Up flew the windows all;</span>
<span class="i0">And every soul cried out, "Well done!"</span>
<span class="i2">As loud as he could bawl.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away went Gilpin,&mdash;who but he?</span>
<span class="i2">His fame soon spread around,</span>
<span class="i0">"He carries weight! he rides a race!</span>
<span class="i2">'Tis for a thousand pound!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And still as fast as he drew near,</span>
<span class="i2">'Twas wonderful to view,</span>
<span class="i0">How in a trice the turnpike men</span>
<span class="i2">Their gates wide open threw.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, as he went bowing down</span>
<span class="i2">His reeking head fell low,</span>
<span class="i0">The bottles twain behind his back</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Were shattered at a blow.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down ran the wine into the road,</span>
<span class="i2">Most piteous to be seen,</span>
<span class="i0">Which made his horse's flanks to smoke</span>
<span class="i2">As they had basted been.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But still he seemed to carry weight,</span>
<span class="i2">With leathern girdle braced;</span>
<span class="i0">For all might see the bottle necks</span>
<span class="i2">Still dangling at his waist.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus all through merry Islington</span>
<span class="i2">These gambols did he play,</span>
<span class="i0">Until he came unto the Wash</span>
<span class="i2">Of Edmonton so gay;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there he threw the wash about</span>
<span class="i2">On both sides of the way,</span>
<span class="i0">Just like unto a trundling mop,</span>
<span class="i2">Or a wild goose at play.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Edmonton his loving wife</span>
<span class="i2">From the balcony spied</span>
<span class="i0">Her tender husband, wondering much</span>
<span class="i2">To see how he did ride.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the house,"</span>
<span class="i2">They all at once did cry;</span>
<span class="i0">"The dinner waits, and we are tired."</span>
<span class="i2">Said Gilpin, "So am I!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But yet his horse was not a whit</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Inclined to tarry there;</span>
<span class="i0">For why?&mdash;his owner had a house</span>
<span class="i2">Full ten miles off, at Ware.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So like an arrow swift he flew,</span>
<span class="i2">Shot by an archer strong;</span>
<span class="i0">So did he fly,&mdash;which brings me to</span>
<span class="i2">The middle of my song.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away went Gilpin out of breath,</span>
<span class="i2">And sore against his will,</span>
<span class="i0">Till at his friend the calender's</span>
<span class="i2">His horse at last stood still.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The calender, amazed to see</span>
<span class="i2">His neighbor in such trim,</span>
<span class="i0">Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,</span>
<span class="i2">And thus accosted him:</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What news? what news? your tidings tell;</span>
<span class="i2">Tell me you must and shall.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Say why bareheaded you are come,</span>
<span class="i2">Or why you come at all?"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,</span>
<span class="i2">And loved a timely joke;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus unto the calender</span>
<span class="i2">In merry guise he spoke:</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I came because your horse would come;</span>
<span class="i2">And, if I well forbode,</span>
<span class="i0">My hat and wig will soon be here,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
<span class="i2">They are upon the road."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The calender, right glad to find</span>
<span class="i2">His friend in merry pin,</span>
<span class="i0">Returned him not a single word,</span>
<span class="i2">But to the house went in;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whence straight he came with hat and wig;</span>
<span class="i2">A wig that flowed behind,</span>
<span class="i0">A hat not much the worse for wear,</span>
<span class="i2">Each comely in its kind.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He held them up, and in his turn</span>
<span class="i2">Thus showed his ready wit,</span>
<span class="i0">"My head is twice as big as yours,</span>
<span class="i2">They therefore needs must fit.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But let me scrape the dirt away</span>
<span class="i2">That hangs upon your face;</span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
